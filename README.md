# File Vault

## Quickstart

Run the script `secure_file.py` for encryption or decryption.

Usage: `python3 secure_file.py <mode>[encrypt: '-e', decrypt: '-d'] '<password>' <target_filename>`

Check the directory where the script was run from for your encrypted or decrypted file.

The output file will have the suffix '_encrypted' or '_decrypted' depending on which mode was chosen.
